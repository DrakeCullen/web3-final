# Lost And Found web application created with the MERN Stack

### I created a lost and found application where users can post pictures and descriptions of items that they lost. Other users will see their posts, and they can contact them if they find the missing item.

<br >

### Access the website at: https://drake-lost-and-found.herokuapp.com/

<br>

### The gifs below may take a minute to load in. They can also be found at: https://github.com/DrakeCullen/Lost-And-Found/tree/main/imgs

<br>

### Here you see the home page that is displayed when a user isn't logged in. If they try to view a post, they will be asked to login or register a new account.

### Here is what the website looks like to an authenticated user. They can view posts, edit posts, create a new post, delete a post, or update their profile.

### When an authenticated user clicks on a post, the post is enlarged so that they can better see its contents.

### A user has the abilility to create a new post. They must fill out all the fields correctly. Afterwards, any other user will see their post.
