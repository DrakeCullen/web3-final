# Message assistant web application created with the MERN Stack

### I created a message assistant application for users who have difficulties typing messages. A caregiver can pre-configure messages, and a user can click the image to send a text message to their caregiver.

### Access the website at: https://web3-message-assistant.herokuapp.com/
